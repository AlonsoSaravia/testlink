Run video traffic on a VPS 6312/14 in the ring.  Break the interconnect between the VPTs.  Verify that odd/even video channels are flooded into the ring from the VPT(s) with the video source.

There should only be a slight pause/ minor macro blocking for channels that were passing over the interconnect (odd or even depending on which channel is being watched and which VPT is sourcing the video).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note - the gap in the video will be the failover time on the redundant routers.

Break a link in the first EPS ring forcing MEPS to flood odd/even channels.  Make sure that when this happens MEPS does not flood odd/even channels on the intact ring.  The intact ring should still have odd/even channels flowing from the PG1 / PG2 bookends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</summary>
